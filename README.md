# iCare_Work
## Overview
The project ‘iCare’ aims to support people with mental health issues. It aims to build two chatbots for this task: Carebot and Coachbot.  
## Carebot
This chatbot aims at providing empathetic responses to their questions and concerns, by employing a participatory iterative user-centered design process to develop the innovative digital application that supports families or individuals in need. It uses an Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning method to train the chatbot model and provide therapeutic response to the users.
## Aim 1. (User interface and backend design and development) Design the UI and the navigations as well as the Database tables, APIs, and workflow of the application.
- Figma will be used for UI design
- React will be used for the front end
- Django for the backend using SQLite database.

## Aim 2. (AI chatbot development) Employ an iterative user-centered design (UCD) approach to develop the intelligent digital application iCare.
RASA will be used for the bot development. Activities include, analyze and sort available data for the chatbot model, find out and process as much data as possible. Voice to text (VTT) feature implementation and testing.

## Aim 3. (Integration, deployment, and Testing) Apply usability testing.

## Coachbot
This chatbot will act as a virtual coach that will assist families/caregiver of the mental health patient to be trained on how they can improve the way they interact with the patient. It is shown through research that lack of training to the caregiver/family results in missed opportunities to offer empathic responses to patients and if provided could bring a great difference in nursing the patient. In therapy, interacting empathically with seekers is fundamental to success. This bot will provide the necessary knowledge to the caregivers to begin treating the patients at home(Hence the name HomeCare). It will act as a patient and will present situations to the caregiver and see how they respond to them. Depending on their answer, it will provide the caregiver feedback on how they can improve their response.
